# Texas Hold'Em

Building out a Poker game to explore the statistics/probabilities and logic behind it.  

Currently playable via CLI; planning to develop a web app to provide a better UI.  

"AI", if you can call it that, participates randomly for the time being, but I plan to add better logic or even develop a QLearner to improve gameplay.  

Yes, the other player names are from Yellowstone. Currently on Season 3 so no spoilers please.
